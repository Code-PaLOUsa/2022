# Here are the slides & demos from the talks I gave at CodePaLOUsa 2022

* ### Azure Without the Portal
    ```
    Most everything you can do in the Azure Portal can also be done via the REST API or the AZ command line tools. This session will show you how to set up scripts to automate common tasks, manipulate Azure resources from a DevOps pipeline, generate ad-hoc reports, and amaze your friends by making Azure bow to your will.
    ```

* ### VS Code All the Things!!!
    ```
    Did you know that you can query your database from VS Code? Or make REST requests? Or manage your Azure functions/storage accounts/app services? The extensibility model of VS Code & the passion of developers around the world means that VS Code can be the Sonic screwdriver in your dev toolkit. Come by and be amazed at what this simple little IDE can do with the right extensions!
